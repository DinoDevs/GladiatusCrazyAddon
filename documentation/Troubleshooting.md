## Log off / Restart your browser / Restart your computer

Sometimes, the most basic and easiest solutions can be the working ones.

If you are having problems, of any kind, simply log off from Gladiatus, restart your whole browser (not only the tab) or as a last resort, try to restart your computer.

## Clear cookies and any other data

GCA offers directly in the settings (Data) to clean only it's all data, we can use this option, but to be completely sure, we should also clean the Gladiatus page data.

By clicking on the lock 🔒 symbol next to the website address, we can find the "website settings", where we can find the clear data button, use it. On some browsers, this might be different, but every browser has an "clear data" button.

## Disable other extensions

Disable any browser extensions that could affect the Gladiatus website (like Ablock, uBlock etc..) and see if your problem is resolved.


## Reinstall GCA

Unistall and install the addon back again, before doing so, we recommend also clearing your cookies and data.

## Browser up-to-date

Modern browsers are updating automatically, but make sure you are using the latest version of your browser by visiting it in the settings, you may also have an pending update and a browser restart is needed.

**Opera**: Click on the main Opera icon and select Update & Recovery.

**Firefox**: Open the menu (on the side), select Help>About Firefox.

**Chrome**: Open the settings and select "About Chrome" in the side menu.

**Edge**: Same as Chrome.

## GCA version check

Make sure you are using the latest version of GCA, you can find it the website footer (GCA vX.X.X) or when you go to your profile settings. GCA is updated automatically, but it may take a few days after a release to reach you (due to the checking process).

The latest stable version is always showed on our <a href="https://github.com/DinoDevs/GladiatusCrazyAddon">Github</a>.

## Look out for console errors

Your browser has an console built-in, you can open it by pressing F12 on your keyboard, there you can see what is happening with the site, together with warning and errors. 

Errors are usually colored red and these are the ones that you are looking for, some errors can be harmless, while some are the ones that are causing you problems.

If you see any, we do recommend reporting them to our <a href="https://github.com/DinoDevs/GladiatusCrazyAddon/issues">Issues</a> section, where we will take a look at it, you may try to fix them at your own risk (if you understand what's wrong and they are easily fixable).

Console error example:

**Beware!** Other extensions that can affect Gladiatus (Adblock, uBlock...) may create console errors, we suggest to disable them before inspecting the console.

## Make sure your connection/computer speed is enough

Gladiatus is mostly made of pictures, GCA is made of scripts, all this can put some load on your internet and hardware, if it's not enough, some parts of the website can stop showing or working as they normally should.

Thus, we recommend checking your internet speed with free tools on the internet (like https://www.speedtest.net/) to make sure it's running fast enough.

For your computer, check the task manager to see if you are not putting too heavy load on your computer, it can slow the browser's abillity to load websites. Disable background applications you don't need to free more resources and speed things up.

## Gladiatus server outages

In some cases, the fault is not on your side, not on addon's side, but even the game servers are having a bad time, sometimes they react slow or not at all, that's not an GCA issue. For more serious problems, we do recommend visiting the official Gladiatus forum.

## Check GCA Github for existings bugs
Check our Github <a href="https://github.com/DinoDevs/GladiatusCrazyAddon/issues">Issues</a> for any existing bugs you may be experiencing, if you find your problem too, it means it's been already reported and we are working on a fix, this fix will be out when a new GCA version will be released (there is no ETA on when).

## If nothing helps
If nothing helps, then this is indeed a GCA bug/error, please create a new issue in the <a href="https://github.com/DinoDevs/GladiatusCrazyAddon/issues">Issues</a> section and describe to us your problem, it is advised that you (if possible) also add any screenshots or any visible errors from your browser console, these will help us to indentify the problem.
